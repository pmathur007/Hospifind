            <p>Due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, hospitals all over the country are being overloaded by patients. The government has urged citizens to stay at home to "flatten the curve." Hospifind aims to alleviate stress on the hospitals and raise the line of healthcare capacity. We take hospital's capacity data and use it to direct patients to hospitals with the capacity to treat them.</p>
